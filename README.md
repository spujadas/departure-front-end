See the [Departure-Python documentation page](https://departure-python.readthedocs.io/) for instructions on how to install the front end for use with the Departure web API server (`departure-web`).



### Releases

Pre-built releases of the static files (HTML, JavaScript, assets) of the front end can be found in the repository's [Releases](https://github.com/spujadas/departure-front-end/releases).



### Build

To build the static files yourself, for instance if you want to contribute to the project, first install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) and [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/).

Next, install the project's prerequisites:

```
yarn install
```

To compile and minify the app for production, run the following command:

```
yarn build
```

The bundled app will be located in the `dist` subdirectory, which you can then expose to the Departure web API server (`departure-web`).

To automatically rebuild the app when you make a change to the source, you can run: 

```
yarn build --watch
```
